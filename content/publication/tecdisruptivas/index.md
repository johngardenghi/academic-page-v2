abstract: "With the technological progress, new ways of doing ordinary tasks emerge daily in various contexts, including the organizational one. To maintain their competitiveness in this changing scenario, companies must change the way they perform their activities, undergoing a process of Digital Transformation. During the past few years, several technologies have been developed, such as Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things, and more recently Digital Reality and Blockchain, which caused great impact on the market. This study aimed to identify the main technologies used in the context of Digital Transformation. Disruptive Technology application models were found in the literature, and similarities were observed between the model found and the case of a Brazilian company, as well as the case of the digitization plan created by the Brazilian government. Disruptive Technologies can be introduced using Digital Transformation Strategies, taking the particular needs of each case into account."
