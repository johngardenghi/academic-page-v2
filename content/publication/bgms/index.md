abstract: "In a recent paper [E. G. Birgin, J. L. Gardenghi, J. M. Mart√≠nez, S. A. Santos, and Ph. L. Toint, Worst-case evaluation complexity for unconstrained nonlinear optimization using high-order regularized models, _Mathematical Programming_ 163(1), 359--368, 2017], it was shown that, for the smooth unconstrained optimization problem, worst-case evaluation complexity $O(\\epsilon^{-(p+1)/p})$ may be obtained by means of algorithms that employ sequential approximate minimizations of $p$-th order Taylor models plus $(p+1)$-th order regularization terms. The aforementioned result, which assumes Lipschitz continuity of the $p$-th partial derivatives, generalizes the case $p=2$, known since 2006, which has already motivated efficient implementations. The present paper addresses the issue of defining a reliable algorithm for the case $p=3$. With that purpose, we propose a specific algorithm and we show numerical experiments."
