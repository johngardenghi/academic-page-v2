abstract: "In this work, we propose an interior-point method for large-scale linearly constrained optimization. This method explores the linearity of the constraints, starting from a feasible point and preserving the feasibility of the iterates. We present the main global convergence results, together with a rich description of the implementation details of all the steps of the method. To validate the implementation of the method, we present a wide set of numerical experiments and a comparative analysis with well known softwares of the continuous optimization community."
